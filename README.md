# My Project Template

Template for python project with multi purpose use case. Thanks cookiecutter!

## How to use it

Install `cookiecutter` locally in your machine and run the following command
afterwards.

    cookiecutter https://github.com/igormcsouza/pyproj-template

Add your custom names for the variables that will be shown to you and the
package template will be created. :partying_face: How awesome!

## Troubleshooting

* `Cookiecutter messes with yaml variables`: Jinja gives an idea on how to go
around this issue:
